# 2D Material Nanolithography Using Atomic Force Microscope (AFM)

This is a GUI program to etch 2D material(graphene, TMD, etc.) into any shape you want. The results depends highly on the humidity of environment. 50% or more humidity leads to very clean etch. Here are some etched graphene examples.

## Examples (graphene)
